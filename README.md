## 🧠 Project Objective

Many online recipes list ingredients using vague units like cups, teaspoons, and spoons, which can vary depending on the ingredient and person measuring. This inconsistency often leads to failed recipes.

**BakeGenius AI solves this by:**
- Converting units like "cups", "tablespoons", etc., into exact grams.
- Using a built-in database of **ingredient densities**.
- Supporting **voice-based input**, **real-time AI assistance**, and **visualizations**.
- Empowering bakers with consistent, professional results every time.
