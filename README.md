# 🍰 BakeGenius.ai – Your Smart Baking Companion

**BakeGenius.ai** is an AI-powered web application that converts vague, inconsistent recipe measurements (like "1 cup of flour") into **precise gram-based quantities** – making baking more reliable, scalable, and accessible to all.

## 🚩 Why I Built This

As an avid home baker, I often found myself frustrated with traditional recipes that use inconsistent volume-based measurements like cups, spoons, or pinches. These units vary depending on:

- How ingredients are scooped (packed or loose)
- Country-specific conversions (US vs UK cups)
- Ingredient density (e.g. 1 cup of oats ≠ 1 cup of sugar)

The result? Failed cakes, wasted ingredients, and endless guesswork.

So, I decided to solve this once and for all — using AI.

## 💡 What It Does

BakeGenius.ai transforms recipes by:

✅ Detecting ingredients and quantities from written recipes  
✅ Mapping them to density-based weight equivalents  
✅ Providing **accurate gram-based conversions**  
✅ Supporting scaling (halve/double) recipes with precision  
✅ Helping diet-focused users calculate exact weights  
✅ Creating a **universal format** regardless of the region

Whether you're a beginner, a food blogger, or a pastry chef — you’ll bake with confidence.

## 🖥️ How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

1. **Input**: User pastes a recipe or ingredient list  
2. **Parsing**: NLP algorithms extract ingredients and quantities  
3. **Lookup**: Density and standard weight values are matched from the database  
4. **Output**: Clean, precise gram-based version of the recipe
